i tried to use this link in our thematic newsletter, and some free checkers told me that this link located in some blacklist.
Maybe we can use the same tool and check all of our links?

one of the ways of cleaning up our newsletter database is to use one of those guys.
plus, we can offer them sponsorship package(they are competitors, Utsav can use it as sales point)
i think we need to try at least test-drive, because removing dead-souls can affect our open-rates(drive them up) and this is good for sponsor reports
