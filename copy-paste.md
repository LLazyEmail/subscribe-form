i tried to use this link in our thematic newsletter, and some free checkers told me that this link located in some blacklist.
Maybe we can use the same tool and check all of our links?

one of the ways of cleaning up our newsletter database is to use one of those guys.
plus, we can offer them sponsorship package(they are competitors, Utsav can use it as sales point)
i think we need to try at least test-drive, because removing dead-souls can affect our open-rates(drive them up) and this is good for sponsor reports

We could also revisit a page like this https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/ and/or each verified contributor having their own newsletter



Can you share your morning routine? How are you keeping yourself in shape?
There's a significant shift in becoming a digital nomad, but we also facing more issues related to health with it.
What should I tell my wife/GF/family about switching to remove work?
I think they didn't ready for that kind of change.
Remove work usually an excellent option for a professional that in his 30-40 and wants to have a more flexible schedule.
But it doesn't work for students or juniors. In my opinion, they need to be put in the same place as other developers. Tell me what do you think.
Are you investing in Bitcoin?
What tools you're using daily as part of your work?
What books do you read to grow as a person
What is your main goal for 2020
What founder shouldn't do while building a remote team?
Team management, recruiting, and team building events are my main concerns of working remotely trend.
I think these topics are hard to overcome, especially for small companies. What do you think?
Burnout is a common issue for remote workers. How do you recharging yourself?
How often should people be trained, working remotely, so they can grow their skills?
What do you think about daily standups? How can remote workers connect with other team members, that working from the office?
When developers are working remotely, it's actually easy to track. You just need to check his pull requests. Salespersons can be tracked by calls/deals. But how to track, for example, designers or managers?
